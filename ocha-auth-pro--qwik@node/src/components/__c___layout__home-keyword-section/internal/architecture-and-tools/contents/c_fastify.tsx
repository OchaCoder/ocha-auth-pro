            OchaAuthPro uses <span class={`color-theme-sub weight-800`}>Fastify</span> as the backend framework, chosen for its balance between speed, developer experience, and community maturity.
          </p>
          <p>
            While frameworks like Elysia or Hono offer excellent performance benchmarks, Fastify provides a more established ecosystem and familiar patternsâ€”especially for developers coming from
            Express.
          </p>
          <p>For a showcase project that includes real-world concerns like cookie handling, plugin management, and extensibility, Fastify serves as a modern but pragmatic choice.</p>
          <p>Its support for decorators, schema-based validation, and easy plugin architecture made it a natural fit for building secure, modular features quickly.</p>
