This route renders an exact copy of the homepage.

The only differences are the URL and that the "SIGN_IN" modal is open by default.

In modern design, user auth often appears as a modal over a semi-transparent overlay.

A challenge arises when users directly visit a modal page URL (e.g. '/signin/')
â€” for example, via bookmark or external link.

Since the modal page is the initial entry point, thereâ€™s no page content underneath,
which can make the experience feel empty or broken.

Some sites handle this by using a static placeholder image behind the modal,
while others expand the modal to fill the entire screen â€” often resulting in sparse or awkward layouts.

This design takes a slightly different approach: it renders the real homepage underneath the modal overlay,
so users arriving at '/signin/' still see meaningful content and can interact with it immediately,
even if they close the modal.

Itâ€™s a small touch, but it can make the experience feel smoother ðŸŒ±
